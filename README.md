# Pre-commit hooks

This repo defines Git pre-commit hooks intended for use with [pre-commit](http://pre-commit.com/). The currently
supported hooks are:

* **terraform-fmt**: Automatically run `terraform fmt` on all Terraform code (`*.tf` files).

## General Usage

In each of your repos, add a file called `.pre-commit-config.yaml` with the following contents:

```yaml
repos:
  - repo: https://github.com/craftech-io/pre-commit
    rev: <VERSION> # Get the latest from: https://github.com/craftech-io/pre-commit/releases
    hooks:
      - id: terraform-fmt
```

Next, have every developer: 

1. Install [pre-commit](http://pre-commit.com/). E.g. `brew install pre-commit`.
1. Run `pre-commit install` in the repo.

Thatâ€™s it! Now every time you commit a code change (`.tf` file), the hooks in the `hooks:` config will execute.

## Running Against All Files At Once


### Example: Formatting all files

If you'd like to format all of your code at once (rather than one file at a time), you can run:

```bash
pre-commit run terraform-fmt --all-files
```
